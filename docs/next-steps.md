# API Development Backlog - Next Steps

This document serves as a backlog of improvements and features needed for the API. Items are organized by priority and category.

## 游댮 High Priority - Infrastructure

### Database Test Setup
**Status:** Blocked - Tests currently fail due to missing database infrastructure
**Impact:** High - Prevents reliable testing and CI/CD

- [ ] Set up test database configuration
- [ ] Create test-specific database migrations
- [ ] Add test database seeding/cleanup scripts
- [ ] Configure Vitest to run migrations before tests
- [ ] Add test database isolation (each test in its own transaction)
- [ ] Document test database setup in README

### Environment Configuration
**Status:** Needs improvement
**Impact:** Medium - Development experience

- [ ] Create comprehensive `.env.example` with all required variables
- [ ] Add environment validation documentation
- [ ] Set up different env configs for test/dev/prod
- [ ] Add validation for production-specific environment variables

## 游리 Medium Priority - Code Quality

### Type Safety Improvements
**Status:** In progress - Several `any` types remain
**Impact:** Medium - Code safety and maintainability

- [ ] Replace `any` types in logger service with proper interfaces
- [ ] Type the error handling system more strictly
- [ ] Add proper typing for test utilities
- [ ] Review and improve domain event typing
- [ ] Add runtime type validation for external API responses

### Error Handling Enhancement
**Status:** Good foundation, needs expansion
**Impact:** Medium - User experience and debugging

- [ ] Add request ID tracking for better error correlation
- [ ] Implement structured error logging
- [ ] Add error metrics/monitoring hooks
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages for different error types
- [ ] Add error boundary patterns for async operations

### Testing Infrastructure
**Status:** Needs expansion
**Impact:** High - Code reliability

- [ ] Add API integration tests (full HTTP request/response cycle)
- [ ] Create test utilities for common domain objects
- [ ] Add performance/load testing setup
- [ ] Implement test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add contract testing between API and frontend

## 游릭 Low Priority - Features & Enhancements

### Authentication & Authorization
**Status:** Basic implementation complete
**Impact:** Medium - Security and user management

- [ ] Add refresh token rotation
- [ ] Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Implement account verification via email
- [ ] Add login attempt rate limiting
- [ ] Add session management endpoints

### API Documentation
**Status:** Swagger setup exists, needs content
**Impact:** Medium - Developer experience

- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation in Swagger
- [ ] Create API usage examples
- [ ] Add response schema documentation
- [ ] Document authentication flows
- [ ] Add interactive API playground

### Monitoring & Observability
**Status:** Basic logging exists
**Impact:** Medium - Production readiness

- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints with dependency checks
- [ ] Add metrics collection (request latency, error rates, etc.)
- [ ] Set up distributed tracing
- [ ] Add alerting for critical errors
- [ ] Create operational dashboards

### Performance Optimizations
**Status:** Not started
**Impact:** Low - Current performance is adequate

- [ ] Add database query optimization and monitoring
- [ ] Implement response caching strategies
- [ ] Add database connection pooling optimization
- [ ] Profile and optimize critical code paths
- [ ] Add request/response compression
- [ ] Implement database query result caching

### Developer Experience
**Status:** Good foundation
**Impact:** Medium - Development velocity

- [ ] Add hot reloading for development
- [ ] Create database seeding scripts for development
- [ ] Add API client generation for frontend
- [ ] Create debugging utilities and tools
- [ ] Add linting rules for domain architecture patterns

## 游늶 Technical Debt

### Code Organization
**Status:** Recently improved
**Impact:** Low - Architecture is solid

- [ ] Consider splitting large domain entities if they grow
- [ ] Add more granular error types for better error handling
- [ ] Review and optimize database transaction boundaries
- [ ] Consider implementing domain event sourcing if needed

### Configuration Management
**Status:** Recently improved
**Impact:** Low - Current setup is working

- [ ] Consider using a configuration management library
- [ ] Add runtime configuration reloading capability
- [ ] Implement feature flags system
- [ ] Add configuration validation at startup

## 游꿢 Future Considerations

### Scalability Preparations
**Status:** Not needed yet
**Impact:** Low - Current scale is manageable

- [ ] Design for horizontal scaling (stateless services)
- [ ] Consider implementing CQRS patterns for complex domains
- [ ] Plan for database sharding if needed
- [ ] Design for microservices architecture if growth requires it

### Security Enhancements
**Status:** Good baseline security
**Impact:** Medium - Always important

- [ ] Add security headers middleware
- [ ] Implement CSRF protection
- [ ] Add input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Regular security dependency audits
- [ ] Add penetration testing to CI/CD pipeline
